Data-Driven Insights with Spotfire!
 📊 Interactive Sales Dashboard to Uncover Regional & Category-Wise Performance
I'm excited to share a sneak peek into a recent dashboard I built using TIBCO Spotfire to analyze sales and profitability across multiple dimensions. This visual delivers key business insights with a clear, intuitive layout.
🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
✅ KPI Chart (Top Row):
 A quick snapshot of Total Profit by Region:
🟦 Central: $40K
🟨 East: $92K
🟥 South: $47K
🟩 West: $108K – Top Performing Region!
✅ Total Sales per Category (Bottom Left):
💻 Technology leads with $836K
🪑 Furniture follows with $742K
✏️ Office Supplies at $719K
 This helps identify which categories are driving revenue and where to focus future efforts.
✅ Discount vs. Sales Scatter Plot (Bottom Right):
 This view helps in analyzing how discounting strategies affect sales volume.
 It shows that while some high discounts correlate with higher sales, many large sales occur with minimal or no discounts – valuable for optimizing pricing strategies.
🎯 Why This Matters?
 As a Data/Business Analyst, transforming raw data into actionable insights is critical. Tools like Spotfire allow me to build real-time, interactive dashboards that empower decision-making across business teams.
